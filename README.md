This project helped me grow as a programmer and I know it is messy but the benefits of learning are greatly larger.
Things I would do instead of the actual strucure:
  - Storing NFTs related data in a database using an ORM.
  - Taking more time to study and read about the tools and frameworks such as Django.
  - Using validators to clean post requests data.
  - Adding a control panel to easily change featured NFTs, fees,...
  - Using Blueprints.
  - A proper http response with the right error.
  - Type hints!
  - Testing more extensively.
  - An API for quicker responses.
